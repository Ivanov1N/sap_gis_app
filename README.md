# Find Missing Assets (SAP and GIS)

This is a simple application for comparing two spreadsheet tables.

## Description

It is designed to work specifically with data tables exported from two different asset management platforms (SAP system and the Geographic Information System).
The application allows you to load these tables, generate a new field by combining two columns, and perform a comparison based on a preselected method. Finally, it checks for any differences between the tables.
If any differences are found, a new table is generated and saved. I used Tkinter Bootstrap for the design layout.
