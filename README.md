# Find Missing Assets (SAP and GIS)

This is a simple application for comparing two spreadsheet tables.

## Description

It works exclusively with data tables exported from two different asset management platforms (SAP system and Geographic Information System). 
You load the tables, generate a new field (combination of two columns) on which the comparison will be made and finally check if there are any differences between the tables (after preselected comparing method). 
If there are any differences, new table is generated and saved. For the design layout I used Tkinter Bootstrap.
